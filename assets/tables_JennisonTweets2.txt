Iâ€™ve opened registration for the 6th #A11y Camp Bay Area on March 7 in San Francisco https://t.co/z094ZCdsDO
@dennisl @SupeRaven @AccessibleJoe @Accessible_Info Learned within the hour from @thebillygregory,choked
He opened my heart and mind through his dedication to his daughter, Siobhan. If you never met him, learn more here https://t.co/r1uoDV09au
Iâ€™m absolutely devastated to have learned about @blacktelephoneâ€™s passing Jan 3. As an #a11y vet, Iâ€™ll always remember him welcoming me early on into the industry w/ open arms, w/ such class, and that signature New Yorker accent of his.
Ending my vacation today catching-up w/ #a11y folks attending #CES2020
@mattmay One day I want to say zero and sit through the uncomfortable pause.
Not to state the obvious, if little to nothing has been done to make a web or mobile #product accessible today, it's pretty safe to conclude the number would be low.
My #a11y wish for the next decade? That the #tech industry stop asking/trying to track "How many people w/ disabilities are using our product today?" Instead, ask how many people could we reach by investing in a11y, which according to the UN is over One Billion people.
Really enjoying the @CHLNewYork Holiday Jazz Cruise, a new part of my Xmas tradition; Happy Holidays ðŸ˜‰

@mattgallowaycbc An absolute loss indeed; I appreciated how she mainstreamed stories on disability especially on your show.
@Acuity_Design Thatâ€™s funny and scary at the same time.
@marascatron @TheMayflowerDC There too ðŸ˜‰, but Iâ€™m in San Diego now, itâ€™s a hotel here.
So my unnamed large hotel has incorrect Braille signage, at least by my door,  as in the room number is wrong; who else has experienced bad Braille signage? #BadBraille
Thereâ€™s a  connection b/w inaccessible/poor public transit and unemployment of people w/ disabilities; sad #NYC couldnâ€™t serve more as a model city. https://t.co/v6nVFWWCqg
Good morning from San Diego, where relaxing weekends are always a guarantee, even when they start w/ a little quaking. ðŸ˜‰
@MollyWattTalks @LinkedIn Molly, recall from our email communications that dynamic type support is incoming.
For context, the last two tweets came after a bit of vacation catch-up reading that included this otherwise interesting article that made only one passing reference to people with disabilities https://t.co/fSgpyEjKSm #inclusion #diversity
Iâ€™d say despite the fact itâ€™s getting increasingly easier to make #tech accessible, the same rationale holds true as a big reason why the pace of digital accessibility adoption is where it is today #a11y

Uncomfortable truth: many people are uncomfortable talking about people w/ disabilities in general, let alone people w/ disabilities using their digital products, which to me is one reason why we are still largely left out of the #diversity and #inclusion in #tech conversation

.@alaskaair Wwhile getting ready to push-back on our new plane, our Capt played Do You Know The Way To San Jose (which drew laughs) , then took the time to recog each of the FAs and his First Officer, and he then took the op to assure us how much safety mattered at Alaska.
.@alaskaair The entire AS322 crew from lst nt deserve high praise  for turning what could have been a painful flt delay sit (inncl a plane chg) into a more than tolerable exp b/c of outstanding cs ; their collective sense of humor while keeping us always informed was exceptional.
